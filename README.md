# Feedback-Button-on-Website
Feedback button to link to form to survey users about their experience


##About
This is a simple feedback button using HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Google Apps Script. 

##Set up

This was implemented on a CMS website like Plone so I used Google Apps Script instead of just using plain JavaScript. 
If you aren't using a CMS system then first make a a DIV placeholder with a unique ID to hold the Google Apps Script web application.
