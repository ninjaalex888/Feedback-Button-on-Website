# Feedback Button on Website
Feedback button to link to form to survey users about their experience


## About
This is a feedback button using HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Google Apps Script. It will get the users feedback through a HTML form and then log the data in Google Sheets and send and Email notifcation to some admins. 

## Set up

This was implemented on a CMS website like Plone so I used Google Apps Script instead of just using plain JavaScript. 
If you aren't using a CMS system then first make a a DIV placeholder with a unique ID to hold the Google Apps Script web application. 

See the relevant files for how it was set up. There is a Google Apps Script file and an HTML page.
